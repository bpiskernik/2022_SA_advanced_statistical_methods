_NOTE FROM BERNHARD PISKERNIK: The results are taken from actual homework submissions. I have selected nice ones, so please allow yourself a smile if you see your solution._


# Tasks

* TASK 1 (2-factors) 
  - Is there any Swiss region, where women/men are especially happy?
  - use the variables `H1` (happy/unhappy), `Nuts2` (region) and `DEMO1` (gender) from the [MOSAiCH](https://doi.org/10.48573/t659-e039) data set
  
* TASK 2 (mixed)
  - Can you reproduce the result regarding _psychological distress_ in [Prudenzi, et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266357)? 
  - The data is available [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZNCWA).
  - Would the result change with a robust approach?

# Preparations

## Libraries

Load required libraries

```{r load_libraries}
# just run this chunk

library(tidyverse)
library(WRS2)
```


## Data

1. Make sure that the [MOSAiCH](https://doi.org/10.48573/t659-e039) data-set is extracted at _[your individual folder path]/2022_SA_advanced_statistical_methods/data_.
2. Make sure that the [ACT for NHS staff data](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZNCWA) is extracted at _[your individual folder path]/2022_SA_advanced_statistical_methods/data_.


# Task 1

## Prep

Get data into shape.

```{r prepare_mosaich_data}
# just run this chunk

df_mosaich <- haven::read_sav('../data/MOSAiCH_2021/swissubase_2033_1_0/2033_MOSAiCH2021_Data_E_v1.0.0.sav') %>%
  # use labels instead of values for Nuts2
  mutate(
    Nuts2 = haven::as_factor(Nuts2),
    DEMO1 = haven::as_factor(DEMO1)
    ) %>%
  # reduce to needed variables
  select(IDNO, Nuts2, DEMO1, H1) %>%
  # remove missings
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    IDNO = as_factor(IDNO),
    # remove missing factor levels
    Nuts2 = forcats::fct_drop(Nuts2),
    DEMO1 = forcats::fct_drop(DEMO1),
    H1 = unclass(H1)
    )
```

Take a look at data to see how it is structured

```{r see_mosaich_data}
# just run this chunk

df_mosaich %>%
  # limit to top 20 rows
  slice_head(n=20)
```

## Optional

Explore the data (this is optional for the homework).

```{r}
# ADD YOUR CODE


```


## Parametric

We start by running a parametric 2-way Anova

```{r}
# just run this chunk
para_2way <- aov(H1 ~ Nuts2*DEMO1, data = df_mosaich)
para_2way
```

Let's check the parameter results

```{r}
# just run this chunk
para_2way %>% summary()
```

### Question

1. Please interpret the results.
2. Which parameter relates to the research question "Is there any Swiss region, where women/men are especially happy?" and how would you answer it based on the results?

### Answer

1. There is a significant main effect of Nuts2 which represents the regions of Switzerland F= 5.15, p <= .001.The other main effect of DEMO1 (gender) is non-significant (p = .484). The interaction effect of regions and gender (Nuts2:DEMO1) is also non-significant (p= .278). This means that there is a significant difference between regions regarding happiness but not between gender (women/men) and that there is no difference in happiness between gender depending on regions.

_NOTE FROM BERNHARD PISKERNIK: Please always add dfs to F values._ 

2. The F-value of the non- significant interaction effect Nuts2*DEMO1 (swiss regions x gender) relates to the question. With post-hoc tests we could determine which region is the happiest in case it would have been significant.]


## Robust

Choose a robust version of the parametric test above in the [WRS2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WRS2/WRS2.pdf) and carry it out.

Start with the omnibus test.

```{r robust_2way_omnibus}
# YOUR CODE
t2way(H1~Nuts2*DEMO1, data = df_mosaich)

```

Also conduct a robust post-hoc test.


You can use the function below to get a more readable print out.

```{r}
# just run this chunk
pretty_2factor_postHoc <- function(mcp2atm_result){
  df <-mcp2atm_result$contrasts %>%
    select(contains(':')) %>%
    t() %>%
    as_tibble(rownames = 'contrast') %>%
    mutate(
      across(where(is.double), ~case_when(
        .x == 0 ~ NA_character_,
        TRUE ~ cur_column()
      ))
    ) %>% 
    unite('description', 2:ncol(.), na.rm = T)
  
  df$p <- mcp2atm_result$effects[[3]]$p.value
  
  df %>%
    mutate(
      p.adj = p.adjust(p, method='fdr')
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      across(where(is.double), round, 3)
    )
}
```


```{r robust_2way_postHoc}
# YOUR CODE
post_hoc <- mcp2atm(H1~Nuts2*DEMO1, data = df_mosaich )

pretty_2factor_postHoc(post_hoc)
```




### Question

1. Please interpret the results.
2. Which result relates to the research question _Is there any Swiss region, where women/men are especially happy?_ and how would you answer it based on the results?

### Answer

1. First, we conducted a robust ANOVA (A two-way ANOVA for trimmed means, M-estimators, and medians: t2way). This robust 2-way omnibus-test does not report any degrees of freedom since an adjusted critical value is used. We therefore received the following results: First of all, there is a significant difference between the seven Swiss regions (Nuts2) regarding happiness (H1) F = 31.05, p = . 001. Furthermore, we obtained the result that there is a significant difference between gender (female and male (DEMO1)) referring to happiness (H1) F = 4.72, p = .03. Third we determined that there is a significant interaction between gender (DEMO1) and region (NUTS2) which implies that happiness (H1) varies between women and men in different Swiss regions F = 16.47, p = .01. In the following we conducted a robust post-hoc-test (robust_2way_postHoc: mcp2atm) for those three results.

_NOTE FROM BERNHARD PISKERNIK: I am not 100% sure that the test statistic is F distributed. For t1way it is and t2way is a generalization of that, but the documentation doesn't state it unambigously. Therefore, I would just call it "test statistic"._

2. The post-hoc-test for the interaction between the regions Zentralschweiz and Ostschweiz (NUTS2) and the variable gender (female/ male (DEMO1)) was significant (padj = .009) and relates to this question. This means that there is a significant difference between women and men in those two regions regarding to happiness. Even though we found a significant interaction effect we can´t say anything about it´s direction.


# TASK 2

## Prep

_Note_: In case you have renamed the folder/file-name (the names defined within the zip-file might be too long for Windows-systems), please adjust the path in the chunk below accordingly.

```{r}
# just run this chunk
df_act_raw <- readxl::read_xlsx('../data/a_workplace_acceptance_and_commitment_therapy_intervention_for_improving_healthcare_staff_psychological_distress/Data _ACT_for_NHS_RCT_Trial_OPS_Prudenzi_et_al_22.xlsx')
```

Take a look at data to see how it is structured.

```{r see_act_data}
# just run this chunk

df_act_raw %>%
  # limit to top 20 rows
  slice_head(n=20)
```

We transform the data into the so called [long](https://www.statology.org/long-vs-wide-data/)-format, because this is required by most analysis functions suitable for this task.

```{r}
# just run this chunk

df_act_long <- df_act_raw %>%
  # limit to required columns
  select(
    starts_with('Psychological_distress'),
    `Experimental_Control participant`,
    ID
  ) %>% 
  # wide to long
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with('Psychological_distress'),
    names_to = 'time',
    values_to = 'psy_distress'
  ) %>%
  # clean strings
  mutate(
    time = stringr::str_replace(time, 'Psychological_distress_', ''),
    time = forcats::as_factor(time),
    # convert to factor and use new name
    group = forcats::as_factor(`Experimental_Control participant`)
  ) %>%
  # drop not needed column
  select(-`Experimental_Control participant`)
```


Take a look at data to see how it is structured now. 

Optional: you might want to check `levels(df_act_long$time)` as well to get the order of time levels. If it doesn't suit your needs you can use `forcats::fct_relevel()` to change it. Use `?forcats::fct_relevel()` to see its manual entry.

```{r see_act_long_data}
# just run this chunk

df_act_long %>%
  # limit to top 20 rows
  slice_head(n=20)
```


## Optional

Explore the data (this is optional for the homework).

```{r}
# ADD YOUR CODE


```



## Parametric



Conduct a parametric mixed ANOVA with `ez::ezANOVA()`. See its manual with `?ez::ezANOVA()`. You don't need to decompose any effects - just the omnibus test is correct.


```{r}
# FILL IN THE CORRECT VARIABLES

para_mixed <- ez::ezANOVA(
  df_act_long,
  wid = ID,
  dv = psy_distress,
  within =  time,
  between = group
)

para_mixed
```

### Question

1. Please interpret the results.
2. Do the results align with those in the paper? (you don't need to check the partial $\eta$² or the decomposed effects)

### Answer

1. A mixed ANOVA 4 (Time: baseline/ mid_intervention/ post_intervention/ follow_up) x 2 (Group: control/experimental) was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of these variables on the psychological distress. 
There is a significant effect of the group on the psychological distress, F(1,96) = 4.68, p < .05, 𝜂g2 = 0.025 (with Greenhouse-Geisser correction). 
There is a significant of the time on the psychological distress, F(3,288) = 14.07, p < .05, 𝜂g2 = .064 (with Greenhouse-Geisser correction). 
There is a significant interaction effect between time and group on the psychological distress, F(3,288) = 3.09, p < .05, 𝜂g2 = .015 (with Greenhouse-Geisser correction). 
It means than the differences between the group are significant, than the psychological distress differs from group. It means also than the differences between time differ and there are some differences which are significant. 

2. Yes we found the same result as the paper. In the paper, they also found a main effect of Time, of Condition (group) and a significant interaction between Time and Condition, p < .05.


## Robust

Choose a robust version of the parametric test above in the [WRS2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WRS2/WRS2.pdf) and carry it out.


```{r robust_mixed}
# YOUR CODE
WRS2::bwtrim(
  psy_distress ~ group*time,
  id = ID,
  data = df_act_long,
  tr = 0.2)

```


### Question

1. Please interpret the results.
2. Do the results align with those in the paper?


### Answer

1. A robust test was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of the variable time and the variable group on the psychological distress. We found a main effect of group, p < .05. It means that the group have a effect on the psychological distress. We also found a main effect of time, p < .05. It means that the variable time has an effect on the psychological distress.There are some significant differences in the variable "time". We didn’t found an interaction between the group and the time, p > .05. These results aren't the same as the results of the parametric test, where we also found a significant interaction effect. 

2. Our results doesn't align with those in the paper. In the paper, they found found a main effect of time and group (like us), and also a significant interaction test.
